This program aligns coding sequences by using their AA translation while allowing frameshifts and stop codons (either real or due to sequence errors).

Advised costs:
=============
By default, sequences are considered to be reliable coding sequences and the costs for frameshifts and stop codons are high (respectively 30 and 50).
If you include reads or contigs from NGS, we advise to assign the corresponding sequences lower costs for frameshifts and stop codons (e.g. respectively 10 and 15, since it is frequent that NGS data contain an extra base or miss one).
Similarly, if you include pseudogenes, we advise assigning to the corresponding sequences lower costs for frameshifts and stop codons (e.g. respectively 15 and 10, since they no longer undergo selective pressure a stop codon can rise from just a recent mutation).
